Hello, here is my Fraction homework. Something you may interested in is written below.
## Files
There three file in total, they are:  
fraction.cpp
CMakeLists.txt
ReadME.md

## Running Tests

In this part, we tested some typical usages. They are 2/3 & 3/4, -1/7 & 4/5, -4/6 & -7/9. Besides, some decimal strings, like 1.414, -3.14. Finally, the inputs of a fraction to test the inserter and extractor for streams.

Here are the outputs.
```
2/3 + 3/4 = 17/12
2/3 - 3/4 = -1/12
2/3 * 3/4 = 1/2
2/3 / 3/4 = 8/9
2/3 < 3/4 : 1
2/3 <= 3/4 : 1
2/3 == 3/4 : 0
2/3 != 3/4 : 1
2/3 >= 3/4 : 0
2/3 > 3/4 : 0
Double value of 2/3 : 0.666667
String value of 3/4 : 3/4

-1/7 + 4/5 = 23/35
-1/7 - 4/5 = -33/35
-1/7 * 4/5 = -4/35
-1/7 / 4/5 = -5/28
-1/7 < 4/5 : 1
-1/7 <= 4/5 : 1
-1/7 == 4/5 : 0
-1/7 != 4/5 : 1
-1/7 >= 4/5 : 0
-1/7 > 4/5 : 0
Double value of -1/7 : -0.142857
String value of 4/5 : 4/5

-2/3 + 7/9 = 1/9
-2/3 - 7/9 = -13/9
-2/3 * 7/9 = -14/27
-2/3 / 7/9 = -6/7
-2/3 < 7/9 : 1
-2/3 <= 7/9 : 1
-2/3 == 7/9 : 0
-2/3 != 7/9 : 1
-2/3 >= 7/9 : 0
-2/3 > 7/9 : 0
Double value of -2/3 : -0.666667
String value of 7/9 : 7/9

Fraction from decimal 1.414 : 707/500
Fraction from decimal -3.14 : -157/50

The copied fraction: -157/50

Enter a fraction: 3/7
You entered: 3/7
```

## Something else
* Something I haven't finished is make a fraction output like a interger, for example: 4/2 => 2, 0/3 => 0. 
* if there are some bugs I haven't found, please email me at yichics02@gmail.com, your mail do give me a encourage to better work.  
* Wish you a nice day!
